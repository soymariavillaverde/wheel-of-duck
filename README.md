# Wheel of Duck

The purpose of "Wheel of Duck" is to create a fair, random, sacrifice system. Once a name appears on screen after pressing the "shoot" button, it cannot appear again until the game restarts. The user has the option to see the player list, add new participants, delete them and, in addition to all of this, they also have the option to edit the name of the users already present. It was developed thinking about mobile first, but it works in any device, be it a tablet, desktop or any other device.
